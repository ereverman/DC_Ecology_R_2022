ERE instructor notes for DC Ecology R workshop 2022


## Logging on to access RStudio Remote Environment:

* Address: https://jupyter.lib.ku.edu
* Click "Sign in with CILogon"
* In the “Select an Identity Provider” box, pull down the menu and search for your institution.
* Choose your institution and click Log On. You will be routed to your institution’s Single Sign On, where you can authenticate.
* Once you have signed in, you will see Server Options. Choose “Stack RStudio” and click Start.
* The server will start; you will see the blue bar move as resources are assigned and the image builds. On first login, this may take 5 minutes or so. You don’t need to do anything while the image builds.
* When everything is ready, you will see a Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser window. RStudio will be a software option in the starter page.
* Since the data is loaded into R as a part of the lesson material, there is no dedicated workshop data directory in this server image – instructors can direct learners to create their working environment in the same way as working with a local installation.
* When you are ready to close the instance, go to File and choose Log Out. Once the server has closed you can close your browser tab.
